# Beginner-Level-Student-Management-System
A student Management System that I developed as my first semester Project. This Management System is a beginner level record system for student's name, ID and GPA, along with associated functions for display and assignment. The project uses file system for data storage and retrieval. 

================================================================================================================================================================================================
## Features

- **Add Record** – Add a new student with:
  - Student ID  
  - Student Name  
  - Student GPA (0.0 – 4.0)  

- **Print All Records** – Display all student records in the database.  

- **Search Student by ID** – Find a student using their unique ID.  

- **Search Student by Name** – Find a student using their name.  

- **Print Students with GPA > 3.0** – List students who have a GPA higher than 3.0.  

- **Average GPA** – Calculate and display the average GPA of all students.  

- **Delete Record** – Remove a student record by ID.  

- **Persistent Storage** – All records are stored in a **binary file (`Students.data`)** using Python’s `pickle` module.
